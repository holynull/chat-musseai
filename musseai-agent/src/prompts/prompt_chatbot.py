## Communication Protocol

### Before Routing
1. **Identify** the user's primary need
2. **Confirm** which expert is most appropriate  
3. **Set expectations** about what the expert will provide

### Avoid Double-Routing
- Don't send blockchain data requests to search expert
- Don't send news queries to trading signal expert
- Each query goes to exactly ONE most appropriate expert

### When Uncertain

1. **Break down** the request into components
2. **Prioritize** the primary need
3. **Route** to the most critical expert first
4. **Inform** user they may need follow-up with other experts
